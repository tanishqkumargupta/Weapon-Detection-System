## Overview

**Weapon Detection System (WDS)** is a full-stack Flask application that wraps a custom-trained **YOLOv5** model in a real, usable security workflow — not just an inference script.

It accepts three kinds of input, each handled through a different path:

- 🖼️ **Uploaded images** — processed server-side with OpenCV + YOLOv5
- 🎥 **A browser webcam** — captured directly in the browser and sent frame-by-frame to the server for detection
- 📡 **An IP / mobile camera stream** — pulled and processed server-side (e.g. an IP Webcam app URL)

Every frame or image is run through the detection model. If a genuine threat class is found (a firearm, knife, or blunt weapon — see [How Detection Works](#how-detection-works)), WDS:

1. Draws bounding boxes and confidence scores on the frame
2. Saves an annotated snapshot to disk
3. Writes a `Detection` record to the SQLite database
4. Sends an HTML email alert with the snapshot attached (rate-limited so a continuous live feed doesn't spam your inbox)
5. Surfaces the event on the dashboard and in the detection history

## Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- Email/username signup and login
- Passwords hashed with **Flask-Bcrypt** (never stored in plaintext)
- Session-based access control — every detection route requires a logged-in user

### 🤖 AI Detection
- Custom-trained YOLOv5 model, loaded locally via `torch.hub`
- Configurable confidence threshold (`model.conf = 0.45` by default)
- Raw model classes are mapped to a small set of human-readable threat categories before anything is stored or alerted on

### 📤 Image Upload Detection
- Upload a single image, get an annotated result rendered back with per-object confidence scores

### 🎥 Browser Webcam Detection
- The browser accesses the local webcam directly via `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` — no server-side camera access involved
- JavaScript captures individual frames and posts them to `POST /detect_frame`
- Flask runs YOLOv5 on each frame and returns an annotated image, which is rendered onto a detection canvas in the browser

### 📡 IP Camera Detection
- Point WDS at an MJPEG/IP camera stream URL (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:8080/video`)
- The server pulls the stream with OpenCV `VideoCapture` and serves an annotated MJPEG stream back through `/video_feed`
- The camera page lets you pick **Webcam** or **IP Camera**; the Start Live Feed / Start Detection controls follow whichever type is selected, and only one feed is active at a time

### 📧 Smart Email Alerts
- Rich HTML email with threat type, confidence, source, and timestamp
- The triggering snapshot is attached automatically
- A **15-second** snapshot cooldown and a **60-second** email cooldown mean not every frame is saved and not every detection sends an email — repeated detections in a short window are throttled

### 📊 Dashboard
- Total detection count, most recent threat + confidence, and a "Recent Detections" panel (last 5 events)

### 📜 Detection History
- Every stored detection — threat type, confidence, source, timestamp, and snapshot — in one searchable, sortable view

## How Detection Works

The raw YOLOv5 output classes aren't shown to the user directly — they're normalized through a label map (`wds_utils/label_mapper.py`) before anything is logged or alerted on:

| Raw model class | Mapped to |
|---|---|
| `Rifle`, `pistol`, `shot-gun`, `submachine-gun` | **Firearm** |
| `knife` | **Knife** |
| `blunt object` | **Blunt Weapon** |
| `Gunmen`, `knife_attacker`, `person` | **Person** |

Only detections that map to `Firearm`, `Knife`, or `Blunt Weapon` are treated as **threats** — a bare `Person` detection is intentionally never stored or alerted on, even though the model may recognize people as part of a scene. For the live camera feed specifically, `Person`-class detections are filtered out before the threat check runs at all.

## Architecture

Image upload and IP camera detection are processed server-side; browser webcam detection is processed frame-by-frame through a dedicated endpoint, since the browser accesses the webcam directly instead of the server.

Image uploads and IP camera frames return an annotated result/stream directly from Flask. Browser webcam frames are annotated server-side per request and rendered onto a canvas in the browser.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- A webcam (optional — only needed for live webcam detection)
- A Gmail account with an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) (optional — only needed for email alerts)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weapon-detection-system.git
cd weapon-detection-system
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

**Windows**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add the YOLOv5 source and trained weights

`detector.py` loads the model locally via `torch.hub.load(YOLO_PATH, "custom", ..., source="local")`, so it expects:

- a `yolov5/` directory at the project root containing the [Ultralytics YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) source
- your trained weights at `weights/best.pt`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
```

## Configuration

Copy the example environment file and fill in your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_google_app_password
ALERT_EMAIL=recipient@example.com
```

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `EMAIL_ADDRESS` | Gmail account WDS sends alerts **from** |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Gmail **App Password** (not your regular password) |

If these aren't set, detection and storage still work — `email_service.py` simply logs `"Email credentials not configured."` and skips sending.
Alert notifications are sent to the email address associated with the currently logged-in WDS user.

## Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

The app starts on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` in debug mode. Open:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

The SQLite database (`instance/wds.db`) and its tables are created automatically on first run.

## Usage

1. **Sign up** for an account, then **log in**.
2. From the **Dashboard**, jump to **Upload**, **Camera**, or **History**.
3. **Upload** — pick an image; WDS returns the annotated result with detected classes and confidence scores.
4. **Camera** — choose **Webcam** or **IP Camera**. For Webcam, the browser asks for camera permission and streams your local camera directly; for IP Camera, enter a stream URL (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:8080/video`) and the server pulls the feed instead. Only one feed type is active at a time. Detections are drawn on the feed as they happen; qualifying threats are saved and alerted according to the cooldowns above.
5. **History** — review every stored detection, newest first.

## Database

Detection events and user accounts are stored in **SQLite**, managed through **Flask-SQLAlchemy**. Two tables:

**`users`**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer | Primary key |
| `username` | String(100) | Unique |
| `email` | String(150) | Unique |
| `password` | String(255) | Bcrypt hash |

**`detections`**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer | Primary key |
| `filename` | String(200) | Snapshot / result filename |
| `threat` | String(50) | Mapped class, e.g. `Firearm` |
| `confidence` | Float | 0.0 – 1.0 |
| `source` | String(50) | e.g. `"Image Upload"` or `"Live Camera"` |
| `timestamp` | DateTime | Defaults to `utcnow` |

## Testing

There's no automated test suite yet, but two standalone smoke-test scripts are included:

```bash
# Confirms OpenCV can open your webcam and displays a preview window
python test_camera.py

# Sends a real alert email using your .env credentials and a sample image
python test_email.py
```

## Design System

The UI ("Signal" theme) is a dark, operations-console aesthetic: mint/cyan for scanning & safety, red for threats, amber for warnings, with a recurring camera-viewfinder "reticle" motif. Typography is **Space Grotesk** (display), **Inter** (body), and **JetBrains Mono** (data, timestamps, badges). Design tokens live in `static/css/variables.css`; see [`CHANGES.md`](CHANGES.md) for the full frontend changelog.

## Roadmap

- [ ] PostgreSQL support for production deployments
- [ ] Docker / containerized deployment
- [ ] Cloud storage for snapshots
- [ ] Multi-camera monitoring
- [ ] REST API
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] SMS / Telegram alert channels
- [ ] Mobile companion app

## Deployment Notes

WDS is deployed as a Flask web application using Gunicorn on Render.

### Current Deployment

- **Platform:** Render
- **Runtime:** Python 3.12
- **Application Server:** Gunicorn
- **ML Inference:** YOLOv5 + PyTorch (CPU)
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Storage:** Local filesystem
- **Model:** `weights/best.pt`

### Important Deployment Considerations

- Environment variables such as `EMAIL_ADDRESS` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` must be configured on the hosting platform.
- The trained model weights and YOLOv5 source must be included with the deployed application.
- SQLite and uploaded/snapshot files use the local filesystem and may not persist across cloud service restarts or redeployments.
- CPU-only YOLOv5 inference can be significantly slower on free hosting compared with a local development machine.
- IP cameras using private LAN addresses such as `192.168.x.x` are generally not reachable from a cloud-hosted server unless the camera is exposed through an appropriate network/relay solution.
- The application is designed primarily as a portfolio/demo deployment rather than a production-grade surveillance platform.
